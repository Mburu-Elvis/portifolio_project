# portifolio project

## project overview

The project is developing a platform connecting products suppliers and customers.
The customers can order goods from the platform.
We provide motorbike riders who deliver those orders to the customers chosen destinations.
Upon delivery the rider initiates payment which sends an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu-sn&q=stkpush">STKPUSH</a> to the customer who authorizes the payment.
