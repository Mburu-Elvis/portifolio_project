# WiShop: Simplifying Shopping with Convenient Delivery

---

WiShop is a revolutionary project aimed at transforming the shopping experience for customers within major cities. By offering a seamless delivery service, WiShop eliminates the need for customers to physically visit supermarkets, saving them valuable time and resources. Our platform provides two types of delivery options: normal and express, catering to different needs and preferences.

## Features

**Convenient Ordering:** Customers can easily place orders through our intuitive web application, selecting from a wide range of available products.  
**Flexible Delivery Options:** Choose between normal delivery for standard shipping times or express delivery for near-instantaneous service, albeit at an additional cost.  
**Streamlined User Experience:** Our integrated web application simplifies the shopping process, reducing the number of applications customers and couriers need to install.
Secure Payments: We leverage USSD services from a reliable telecom company for secure payment processing, ensuring smooth and hassle-free transactions.
**Licensed Riders:** To mitigate operational risks, we carefully select licensed riders who undergo thorough background checks, prioritizing safety and security.
Risks
**Technical Risks**
Our dependency on USSD services for payment processing poses a potential technical risk. Any disruption or downtime in these services could impact our ability to receive payments and subsequently affect business operations.

**Non-Technical Risks**
Operational risks, such as accidents or robberies during delivery, are inherent in our business model. However, we take proactive measures to minimize these risks, including the careful selection of licensed riders and the implementation of robust security protocols.

**Infrastructure**
WiShop utilizes GitHub as our primary code hosting platform, leveraging Git for version control. Our development workflow involves creating feature branches, submitting pull requests for review, and merging changes into the main branch. This ensures a collaborative and organized approach to software development.

**Getting Started**
To get started with WiShop, simply visit our website and create an account. From there, you can start browsing products, placing orders, and selecting your preferred delivery option. Our user-friendly interface makes the entire process quick and straightforward.

**Contributing**
We welcome contributions from the community to help improve WiShop and enhance the shopping experience for our users. Whether it's through code contributions, bug fixes, or feature suggestions, we value your input and collaboration.
